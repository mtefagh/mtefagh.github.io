=== [./game/home.html *22058* Algorithmic Game Theory]
Term: Fall 2021 | Units: 4 | Section: 01 | Students enrolled: 15 | Lectures: Sun, Tue 8:00--10:00am | Exam Date\/Time: 1\/15\/22 3:00pm | Prerequisite: Some optimization experience and familiarity with economics.\n
~~~
{}{img_left}{./game/Incentivus.png}{Project Incentivus}{250}{}{./game/home.html}
Frontiers in mechanism design and incentive engineering for cryptoeconomic systems such as decentralized finance (DeFi). This course focuses on both the systemic risks at the protocol level ranging from miner extractable value (MEV) to transaction fee price manipulation and the economic exploits on the incentive layer like malicious flash loan transactions and the horrors of the dark forest. Through a wide variety of examples of issues stemming from incentive misalignment, we will see the emergence of adversarial attacks by self-interested rational agents who behave strategically to optimize their own objectives and values. 
~~~

This is the alpha version of a course on the ongoing research and open problems in algorithmic game theory. Many advanced topics and cutting-edge issues in the field are discussed, which require mathematical maturity at the level of Ph.D. courses. There is no official textbook for the course.

{}{img_left}{word_art.png}{Word cloud of COBRA keywords}{250}{}{./bio/home.html}
This course discusses computational systems biology focusing on select topics in fluxomics in a well-balanced mixture of biology, mathematics, and computer science. We start by looking in detail at the mathematical underpinning of constraint-based analysis of genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions and provide a foundation for the analysis of optimization algorithms involved. Subsequently, we provide an overview of various papers and toolboxes from the literature in the remainder of the semester. Students will explore concepts through a research-oriented term project that will require them to define goals, success metrics, and deliverables for a computational challenge in systems biology and implement and evaluate a solution.

[https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/13249450 Applications of convex optimization in metabolic network analysis] can serve as an auxiliary text. Moreover, we will use the [http://works.bepress.com/scott_hinton/41/ constraint-based modeling lectures] from a course on metabolic modeling taught by Scott Hinton.
