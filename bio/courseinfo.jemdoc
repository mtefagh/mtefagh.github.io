== Textbook and optional references
The textbook is [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/book/10.1002/9781119188902 Optimization Methods in Metabolic Networks].

== Prerequisites
Good knowledge of convex optimization (as in 22494), and exposure to bioinformatics.\n

You will use one of the [https://opencobra.github.io/cobratoolbox/ COBRA] toolbox (Matlab),
[https://opencobra.github.io/cobrapy/ COBRApy] (Python), or
[https://opencobra.github.io/COBRA.jl COBRA.jl] (Julia) to write simple scripts, so basic familiarity with elementary programming will be required. We refer to COBRA, COBRApy, and COBRA.jl collectively as COBRA*.
