=== [/https://mtefagh.github.io/qfca/ A COBRA toolbox extension for quantitative flux coupling analysis]
Compressed biological systems of tens of thousands of biochemical reactions by a hierarchical organization of pathways which speeds up the downstream analysis up to $3\times$ in addition to saving memory and storage space

=== [/https://mtefagh.github.io/swiftcore/ A COBRA toolbox extension for context-specific metabolic network reconstruction]
Accelerated the state-of-the-art in genome-scale metabolic network reconstruction more than $10\times$ by convex optimization techniques such as factorization, approximation, and regularization
- *Project name:* +SWIFTCORE+
- *Project homepage:* [https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/swiftcore.html]
- *Operating system(s):* Platform independent
- *Programming language:* MATLAB
