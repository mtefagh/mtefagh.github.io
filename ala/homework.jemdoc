This year we have mostly programming assignments, and we will use an [online judge system http://judge.math.sharif.edu/] to grade the coding exercises. The problems will normally be assigned on Saturdays, and due the Saturday after the next by 11:59 pm. However, the exact deadlines to submit your solutions are one day before those for Linear Algebra I announced in [https://hamband.math.sharif.edu/wiki/%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%B4%DA%A9%D8%AF%D9%87/%D8%AF%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B3/22255/13992 here].

You will have theory problem sets for the first few weeks. Afterward, most of the assignments require you to use the [https://julialang.org/ Julia] programming language.
