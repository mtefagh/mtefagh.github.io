== Instructor
[/../index.html Mojtaba Tefagh], [/https://goo.gl/maps/yihSW6s2ZYRQ73Vu9 Math 205],
[mailto:mtefagh@sharif.edu mtefagh@sharif.edu].

== Lectures
Lectures are Sundays and Tuesdays, 8:00--10:00 am, and are live streamed online via [https://vc.sharif.edu/ch/mtefagh webinar]. Click [https://vc.sharif.edu/help/ here] to learn more about our webinars.\n

Videos of all in-class lectures will be available on [http://ocw.sharif.edu/teacher/id/128/%D9%85%D8%AC%D8%AA%D8%A8%DB%8C-%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%82.html OCW] shortly after the end of the semester but should not be considered a substitute for coming to class. You are encouraged to attend the live webinars, but the recorded videos are available in the course Telegram group, hence you can watch the lectures asynchronously.

== Homework
This year we have only programming assignments and we will use the [https://quera.ir/overview/add_to_course/course/7511 Quera] online judge system to grade the coding exercises. The enrollment code for Quera is ALA. The problems and the deadlines to submit your solutions are also announced there.

== Quera
Please use the course's [https://quera.ir/course/7511/ Quera forum] to ask (and answer) questions about the course materials; there will be some extra credit for high quality contribution.

== Office hours
 *Mojtaba Tefagh's office hours:* Sundays and Tuesdays, 10:00--11:00 am, via [https://vc.sharif.edu/ch/mtefagh webinar].\n\n

 *TA office hours:*
 The TAs will offer informal working sessions via [https://vc.sharif.edu/ch/t.mogtaba webinar], that will
 also serve as their office hours, starting the second week of class. Attendance is not required.

== Textbook and optional references
This course is originally developed by [http://stanford.edu/~boyd/ Stephen P. Boyd]. The course materials are the same as [https://web.stanford.edu/class/engr108/ ENGR108] at Stanford. Specifically, the textbook and lecture slides can be found [https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/vmls/ here].

== Course requirements and grading
. *Requirements:*
 .. /Weekly homework assignments/, due each Friday 5pm, starting February 21. You are allowed, even encouraged, to work on the homework in small groups, but you must write up your own homework to hand in. Each question on the homework will be graded on a scale of {0, 1, 2}. Some assignments require you to use convex programming software such as [http://cvxr.com/cvx/ CVX] (Matlab), [https://www.cvxpy.org/ CVXPY] (Python), [http://convexjl.readthedocs.org Convex.jl] (Julia), or [https://cvxr.rbind.io/ CVXR] (R), which we refer to as CVX*.
 .. /Midterm quiz/. The format is an in-class, 75 minute, closed book, closed notes midterm scheduled for Sunday April 5.
 .. /Final exam/.  The format is a 24 hour take home, scheduled for the last week of classes, nominally Sunday June 28--29.
. *Grading:* Homework 20\%, midterm 10\%, final exam 70\%. These weights are approximate; we reserve the right to change them later.

== Prerequisites
Exposure to computer programming and good knowledge of linear algebra (as in 22255 or equivalent background) is a prerequisite or corequisite.\n

You will use the relatively new [https://julialang.org/ Julia] programming language to write /very simple/ scripts for computations with vectors and matrices, so basic familiarity with elementary programming will be required. However, a strong background in programming (with Julia or otherwise) is not expected.
